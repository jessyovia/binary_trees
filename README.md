Binary Trees Project

Overview

This project centers around the implementation of functions related to binary trees within the C programming language. Through a series of tasks, it addresses various facets of binary trees, including creation, traversal, and manipulation. The project is crafted with specific coding standards and constraints in mind to ensure the resulting code is clean and easily understandable.

Intended Audience

Developers and students seeking to deepen their comprehension of binary trees, data structures, and algorithms within the realm of C programming will find this project valuable. It offers practical, hands-on experience in working with binary trees while upholding coding standards.

Project Layout

The project is structured into distinct tasks, each focusing on specific elements of binary trees. These tasks encompass the creation of binary trees, the implementation of traversal algorithms, and the handling of various types of binary trees such as AVL trees and binary search trees.
